This is a Flutter based replacement of the [Volt Campaigner App](https://gitlab.com/VoltEuropa/data-analytics/data-analytics-europe/volt-campaigner).
It is a complete rewrite with enhanced Features.

# Features
- [x] Create Posters
- [x] Edit Posters
- [x] Unhang and Recycle Posters
- [x] Create Placement Markers (like Storage and Meetpoint)
- [x] Search a location and jump to it to see the Posters there
- [x] Poster Tags
- [x] Filter Posters by Status, Date, ...
- [x] Record your Flyer Route
- [x] Create Areas with Poster Limits

# Getting Started
Currently it canÂ´t be pushed into the App Stores, because it uses the public OpenStreet-Map and Nomatim servers.
But we are looking forward to change that soon.

You can checkout the [Releases](https://github.com/Y0ngg4n/volt_campaigner/releases) to test it.

# Roadmap
Checkout the current [Development](https://github.com/Y0ngg4n/volt_campaigner/projects/2)
